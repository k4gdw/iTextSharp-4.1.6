#iTextSharp-4.1.6

This is my fork of the MPL / LGPLv2 version of the 
iTextSharp library preserved on GitHub.com for posterity.

I'm keeping the solution updated to the latest version of VIsual
Studio that I have access to.

	- Opened the solution in VS2012 to let it do whatever it
	  does to upgrade it's format.
	- Renamed README to README.md
	- Added markup so that the README.md file is nicely
	  formated in both plain text as well as parsed
	  markdown.
